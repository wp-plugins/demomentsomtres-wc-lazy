Adds BJ Lazy Load compatibility to WP Canvas Gallery

== Description ==
WP Canvas Gallery is a great gallery with a Masonry or Pinterest effect.

However, in very big galleries, it is to slow but it doesn't work fine with BJ-Lazy-Load that implements Lazy Load for WordPress at it losts the Masonry effect.

So, when we were implementing both plugins in http://espaimoble.com where there are really big galleries based on WP Canvas Gallery, we where forced to implement this plugin to implement the compatibility.

=== Thank you ===
This plugin it's been possible thanks to the great job of:
* Bj√∏rn Johansen in (BJ-Lazy-Load|http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/bj-lazy-load/)
* Chris Baldelomar in (WP Canvas Gallery|http://wordpresscanvas.com/features/gallery/)
